1,14:18:54,Who serves as the Controlling Chief of examinations for a Department?,"

Based on the exam manual, the **Head of the Department (HoD)** serves as the Controlling Chief of examinations for a Department.

The manual specifically states: ""When an examination is conducted for a course unit/module conducted under a Department, the Head of relevant Department (HoD) will serve as the controlling chief of Examination.""

The Controlling Chief has several important responsibilities including:
- Nominating question paper setters, moderators, and marking examiners
- Ensuring examinations are marked by approved examiners within stipulated time
- Maintaining appropriate records related to in-course assessments
- Ensuring proper transfer of answer scripts and mark sheets among examiners
- Guiding chief examiners for orderly conduct of assessments
- Ensuring assessment components and weightages are correct
- Checking student performance distribution in examinations
- Reporting any misconduct, errors, or negligence to the Dean of the Faculty

In cases where a course unit/module is not conducted under a Department, the controlling chief would be the HoD of the Department to which the Chief Examiner belongs, or a senior academic appointed by the Senate on the recommendation of the Faculty Board."
