1,19:00:57,What is the minimum SGPA required,"
Based on the student handbook, the minimum SGPA requirement is **2.00**.

Here are the key details:

**Minimum SGPA Requirement:**
- **2.00** is the minimum SGPA required to earn credits for C- grades in a proper attempt
- Students can only earn credits for C- grades if they achieve an SGPA of 2.00 or above
- Additionally, in that semester, they can have no more than three grades at the level of C- or below

**Passing Grade Requirements:**
- **Grade C or above** (45-49 marks = 2.0 GPV) is the normal requirement to pass a module
- **Grade C-** (40-44 marks = 1.7 GPV) is a conditional pass grade
- **Grade E** (0-39 marks = 0.0 GPV) is a failing grade

**Important Note:**
- Students cannot earn credits for C- grades in repeat attempts
- Students can improve a C- grade to C by repeating the module

The SGPA is calculated using the formula:
SGPA = Σ(cj × GPVj) / Σ(cj)
Where cj is the number of credits for module j and GPVj is the Grade Point Value earned for module j."
1,19:02:22,can u give me it in simple way,"

The minimum SGPA required is **2.00**.

This means you need to maintain at least a 2.00 Semester Grade Point Average to:
- Pass your modules
- Earn credits for your courses

1,19:17:31,what is the minimum SGPA requirement,"
The minimum SGPA requirement is **2.00**.

This means you need to maintain at least a 2.00 Semester Grade Point Average to pass your courses and earn credits."
1,19:18:31,what about it with C- pass?,"

For C- grades (40-44 marks), the SGPA requirement is **2.00**.

**Key rules for C- grades:**
- You need **SGPA ≥ 2.00** to earn credits for C- grades
- You can have **no more than three C- or lower grades** in that semester
- In **repeat attempts**, you cannot earn credits for C- grades
- You can improve a C- to C by repeating the module

So even if you get C- grades, they only count toward your degree if your overall semester SGPA is 2.00 or higher, and you don't have too many low grades that semester."
