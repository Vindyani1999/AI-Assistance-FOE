1,19:51:24,What is the Swiss Airlines cancellation policy for different fare types?,"
Based on the Swiss Airlines policy information I found, here's what I can tell you about their cancellation policy for different fare types:

## Most Flexible Fare Types:
- **Flex and Business Flex**: These are the most flexible fare types that allow you to cancel your flight up to **24 hours before departure without any penalty**.

## Other Fare Types:
- **Non-flexible economy class tickets**: These will incur cancellation fees if cancelled
- **General policy**: For fare types other than Flex and Business Flex, cancellation fees may apply

## Cancellation Fee Structure:
- **24-hour window**: Cancellations made outside the 24-hour window before departure will incur fees
- **Fee calculation**: Cancellation fees depend on:
  - Your fare type
  - The time of cancellation (how close you are to the departure date)
- **Progressive fees**: The closer you cancel to the departure date, the higher the cancellation fee

## Alternative Options:
- **Changes instead of cancellation**: In some cases, Swiss Airlines may allow you to make changes to your flight instead of cancelling outright, though these changes may also come with fees or penalties depending on your fare type and the type of change requested.

## Airline-Cancelled Flights:
- If Swiss Airlines cancels your flight, you may be entitled to a full refund or rebooking on another flight.

Note: The policy information appears to be cut off at the end, so there may be additional details about specific fare types or special circumstances not covered in this response. For complete and current information, I'd recommend checking Swiss Airlines' official website or contacting their customer service directly."
1,20:49:40,How many core modules are there in the Electrical and Information Engineering in bylaw ?,"
Based on the bylaw search results, I can see that for Electrical and Information Engineering, the **minimum credit requirement for Core Modules is 116 credits**. However, the search results don't specify the actual number of individual core modules - they only show the credit distribution.

The table shows:
- **Core Modules**: 116 credits minimum requirement
- Technical/General Elective Modules: 28 credits
- Industrial Training: 6 credits

To get the exact number of core modules (rather than just the credit requirement), you would need to consult the specific curriculum or syllabus documents that detail how many individual modules make up those 116 credits. The bylaw appears to focus on credit requirements rather than module counts.

Would you like me to search for more specific information about the curriculum structure or module breakdown for Electrical and Information Engineering?"
1,20:52:41,any attendance polyce lectures  ?,"
Based on the student handbook, there is an attendance policy for lectures. The regulation states:

**Minimum attendance requirement:**
- **80% attendance for theory classes**
- **Completion of all laboratory sessions/field sessions/design sessions/work**

This means students must maintain at least 80% attendance in theory lectures and must complete all laboratory, field, design, or work sessions as required."
